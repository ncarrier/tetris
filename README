Notes
   About key repeats :
      As one needs to be priviledged to access raww keypresses and key releases,
   tetris is forced to work with the system's key repeats.

   About the sound :
      Tetris relies on oss, which has "disappeared" in modern linux
   distribution, to make sound work properly, one need to use an oss wrapper
   which nearly every new sound system provide. For exemple, with aoss, in the
   debian package alsa-oss, simply type :
      aoss ./tetris
